## **Key Achievements / Projects**

### **Galleon DAO \- Founding & Raising**

Conceived and developed a suite of composable, automated strategy tokens on Ethereum that allowed users to access complex DeFi strategies through a single token. I led full-stack development, implemented smart contracts, and built the Web3 frontend interface. As founder, I hired and managed a core team of 6 members while transitioning the project into a tokenised DAO with onchain governance. This resulted in $20M+ in product investments and attracted $1M in funding from top VCs (1kx) and industry angels (Bankless, Anthony Sassano). The platform significantly reduced complexity for users and introduced innovative financial products to the DeFi ecosystem.

### **Brava \- Production MVP Delivery**

Led the product strategy and management of Brava's DeFi protocol focused on risk-adjusted yield strategies. I defined the product vision and MVP, established the strategic roadmap, and managed a cross-functional team to bring the product to market. I created detailed product requirements that integrated key technologies like Circle CCTP V2 while ensuring alignment between business objectives and technical feasibility. This created a more accessible yield generation platform for users while maintaining robust security standards and navigating the complexities of the current regulatory landscape.
